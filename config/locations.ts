      "From the reclaimed-land high-rises of South Mumbai to the business towers of the Bandra-Kurla Complex and the mixed residential-industrial belts further north, Mumbai's building stock varies enormously in age, material and height. A signal setup that works in a 1970s South Mumbai apartment block rarely suits a glass-façade tower in a newer business district, which is why we treat every property as its own assessment rather than applying one citywide template.",
